# TrojanAsteroids
Part II Computing Project on Trojan Asteroids

This project was aimed at investigating the stability about the two off-axis Lagrange Points (points of equilibrium in a two-body rotating system)

- Lagrange Points are very useful for positioning satellites and telescopes (e.g. James Webb)
- All three on-axis Lagrange Points are analytically unstable (or pseudo-stable) whereas the off-axis Lagrange points are stable depending on the ratio of the masses of the system
- A particular focus was taken on the Sun Jupiter system, where one finds Greek and Trojan Asteroids collecting around the L4 and L5 Lagrange Points
