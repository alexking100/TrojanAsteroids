long term solution to ODE for trojan and greek asteroids

stability of orbit about lagrange point for sun and jupiter
stability dependence on mass of planet - mars, earth



additional plots or ideas

DONE - field plot showing 5 lagrange points 
- transfer orbit
- density of trojan/greek asteroids in real life and model of how they rotate
- earth and moon lagrange points
- unstable orbits, james webb telescope
- lissajous curves for other Lagrange Points

TO DO LIST
- abstract code - renew all the functions which I have left behind to make sure they still run smoothly.
- how do I get the measured time period into a function used to set up the ODE (for starting velocity of the asteroid at the lagrange point)?
Can I get this velocity theoretically without using time period? 


NOTES FOR REPORT

- ode over ivp
- abstracting code because confusing number of variables in a single array (Point, ODE class)
- rotating frames of reference
