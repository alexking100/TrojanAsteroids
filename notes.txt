long term solution to ODE for trojan and greek asteroids

stability of orbit about lagrange point for sun and jupiter
stability dependence on mass of planet - mars, earth



additional plots or ideas

- field plot showing 5 lagrange points
- transfer orbit
- density of trojan/greek asteroids in real life and model of how they rotate
- earth and moon lagrange points
- unstable orbits, james webb telescope
- lissajous curves for other Lagrange Points

TO DO LIST
- abstract code
- why do orbits not overlap ?
